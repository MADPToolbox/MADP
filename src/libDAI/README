What is libDAI?
---------------
libDAI is a free/open source C++ library (licensed under GPL) that provides
implementations of various (deterministic) approximate inference methods for
discrete graphical models. libDAI supports arbitrary factor graphs with
discrete variables (this includes discrete Markov Random Fields and Bayesian
Networks).

libDAI is not intended to be a complete package for approximate inference.
Instead, it should be considered as an "inference engine", providing various
inference methods. In particular, it contains no GUI, currently only supports
its own file format for input and output (although support for standard file
formats may be added), and provides no visualization.

Because libDAI is implemented in C++, it is very fast compared with e.g. MatLab
implementations. libDAI does provide a MatLab interface for easy integration
with MatLab. Currently, libDAI supports the following deterministic approximate
inference methods:

    * Mean Field
    * (Loopy) Belief Propagation
    * Tree Expectation Propagation
    * Generalized Belief Propagation
    * Double-loop GBP
    * Loop Corrected Approximate Inference

Exact inference by JunctionTree is also provided.

Many of these algorithms are not yet available in similar open source software,
to the best of the author's knowledge (open source packages supporting both
directed and undirected graphical models are Murphy's BNT, Intel's PNL and gR.

The library is targeted at researchers; to be able to use the library, a good
understanding of graphical models is needed. However, the code will hopefully
find its way into real-world applications as well. 


Rationale
---------
In my opinion, the lack of open source reference implementations hampers
progress in research on approximate inference. Methods differ widely in terms
of quality and performance characteristics, which also depend in different ways
on various properties of the graphical models. Finding the best approximate
inference method for a particular application therefore often requires
empirical comparisons. However, implementing and debugging these methods takes
a lot of time which could otherwise be spent on research. I hope that this code
will aid researchers to be able to easily compare various (existing as well as
new) approximate inference methods, in this way accelerating research and
stimulating real-world applications of approximate inference.  


Releases
--------
A first release is planned for December 2006 at
http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/~jorism/libDAI/ and will be licensed under GPL.


Acknowledgments
---------------
The development reported here is part of the Interactive Collaborative
Information Systems (ICIS) project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic
Affairs, grant BSIK03024. I would like to thank Martijn Leisink for providing
the basis on which libDAI has been built.


Known issues
------------
Due to a bug in GCC 3.3.x and earlier (http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20358) 
it doesn't compile with these versions (it does compile with GCC version 3.4 and higher).
Workaround: replace the two NAN's in factor.h causing the error messages by -1.

Almost nonexistant. But I'm working on it. In the meantime, I'll provide limited support

Quick start
-----------
You need:
- a recent version of gcc (version 3.4 at least)
- the Boost C++ libraries
- GNU make

To build the source, do:
    
    make

If the build was successful, you can test the example program:

    ./example tests/alarm.fg

or the more elaborate test program:

    tests/test --aliases tests/aliases.conf --filename tests/alarm.fg --methods JTREE_HUGIN BP_SEQMAX
